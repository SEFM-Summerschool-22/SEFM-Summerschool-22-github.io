## Course Descriptions

**Design and Verification of Reliable Autonomous Systems, Michael Fisher** 

Aim is to cover the software engineering, and particularly verification
techniques, that might be used in developing trustworthy autonomous
systems. The draft content of the lectures is as follows:

1. Autonomous Systems: what is Autonomy; why it is different; requirements 
   and specifications; applications and issues; regulation and standards.
2. Architectures and Transparency: modularity and heterogeneity; systems 
   architectures and agents; importance of transparency.
3. Verification (static): heterogeneous verification; model-checking 
   critical components; from “what” to “why”; dealing with opaque components.
4. Verification (dynamic): change and the need for run-time verification; 
   certification and verification assumptions; putting it all together; 
   remaining issues

Much of the material is from a forthcoming book on “Verifiable 
Autonomous Systems” by Louise A. Dennis and Michael Fisher
(due to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2022).

## CVs of the Lecturers 

[Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael) is Professor of Computer Science and Royal Academy
of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies at the University of
Manchester, UK. His 
research covers the verification and trustworthiness of autonomous 
systems, and he works with applications across nuclear robotics, 
offshore vehicles, space robotics, and domestic robotic assistants.

He is co-chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on the Verification 
of Autonomous Systems, is member of both the British Standards 
Institution (BSI) AMT/10 committee on Robotics and the IEEE P7009 
committee on Fail-Safe Design of Autonomous Systems, and chairs 
the BSI committee on Sustainable Robotics.
