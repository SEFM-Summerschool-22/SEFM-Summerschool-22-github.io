## Course Descriptions

**Security Testing** ([Eduard Enoiu](http://www.es.mdh.se/staff/349-Eduard_Paul_Enoiu))

Industrial software is subject to numerous vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, several techniques exist to prevent and detect software flaws. This crash course introduces students to basic and advanced approaches to testing trustworthy industrial control systems by focusing on the interplay between security and safety. Various test techniques will be covered, along with fault detection aspects and the bindings on software security.
 
**Design and Verification of Reliable Autonomous Systems** ([Michael Fisher](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/michael.fisher.html))

Aim is to cover the software engineering, and particularly verification
techniques, that might be used in developing trustworthy autonomous
systems. The draft content of the lectures is as follows:

1. Autonomous Systems: what is Autonomy; why it is different; requirements 
   and specifications; applications and issues; regulation and standards.
2. Architectures and Transparency: modularity and heterogeneity; systems 
   architectures and agents; importance of transparency.
3. Verification (static): heterogeneous verification; model-checking 
   critical components; from “what” to “why”; dealing with opaque components.
4. Verification (dynamic): change and the need for run-time verification; 
   certification and verification assumptions; putting it all together; 
   remaining issues

Much of the material is from a forthcoming book on “Verifiable 
Autonomous Systems” by Louise A. Dennis and Michael Fisher
(due to be published by Cambridge University Press in 2022).

 **Designing Self-adaptive Systems** ([Danny Weyns](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~danny.weyns/))
 
In this course, we will introduce the basis principles of self-adaptive systems. Next, we will outline key milestones of research in this area and highlight the relevance of self-adaptation in practice. Then, we elaborate on runtime techniques that enable self-adaptive systems to provide guarantees that the systems comply with their goals while dealing with uncertainties that are difficult to anticipate at development time. The course concludes with an outline of open challenges in this interesting field of research. 

## CVs of the Lecturers 

[Eduard Enoiu](http://www.es.mdh.se/staff/349-Eduard_Paul_Enoiu) is a Senior Lecturer at Mälardalen University in Sweden. Previously, he worked at Bombardier Transportation in Sweden as a testing tool engineer and industrial Ph.D. researcher. Eduard received his Ph.D. from Mälardalen University in automatic test generation and fault detection evaluation. His current research interest is the automatic discovery of flaws and vulnerabilities in industrial control software. In addition, his interests span software engineering and empirical research, especially testing, maintaining, evolving, and assuring industrial software. He has developed, helped in the development, or led the construction of several tools that have discovered bugs in industrial control systems.

[Michael Fisher](https://web.cs.manchester.ac.uk/~michael) is Professor of Computer Science and Royal Academy
of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies at the University of
Manchester, UK. His 
research covers the verification and trustworthiness of autonomous 
systems, and he works with applications across nuclear robotics, 
offshore vehicles, space robotics, and domestic robotic assistants.

He is co-chair of the IEEE Technical Committee on the Verification 
of Autonomous Systems, is member of both the British Standards 
Institution (BSI) AMT/10 committee on Robotics and the IEEE P7009 
committee on Fail-Safe Design of Autonomous Systems, and chairs 
the BSI committee on Sustainable Robotics.   

[Danny Weyns](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~danny.weyns/) is a professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. He is also affiliated with Linnaeus University Sweden. Danny’s research interests are in engineering self-adaptive software systems. Such systems are equipped with a feedback look that enables them to deal with uncertain operating conditions, such as dynamics in the availability of resources, workloads that are difficult to predict and user goals that change on the fly. The focus of Danny's current research is on ensuring trustworthiness of self-adaptive systems, with validation in the domain of the Internet of Things.
